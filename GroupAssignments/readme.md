**Introduction to Research Question:**

The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) defines an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) as “an attached or detached residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons and is located on a lot with a proposed or existing primary residence.” Further, it holds that an ADU shall include “permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation on the same lot as the single family or multifamily dwelling is or will be situated.”

The permitting of ADUs has increased dramatically in California following state legislation enacted in early 2017. Collectively known as “SB 1069,” Senate Bill 1069 and Assembly Bill 2299 effectively limit a city’s authority to regulate the development of ADUs. SB 1069 replaced any existing ADU building, parking and use standards that cities had in place and imposed standards on cities that had not yet adopted their own. Permit activity has been concentrated in the state’s major cities metropolitan areas, including the Bay Area, San Diego and Los Angeles.

Our research proposal will focus on the Los Angeles region and explore the relationship between the median income of its neighborhoods and the number of ADU permits filed from 2017 to present day.  

**Relevance of Topic:**

In Los Angeles, ADUs can be permitted on any parcels that allow for residential use, including those zoned for single family. This is significant because nearly half of all land in the city of LA includes single family homes. The development of ADUs offers one way to increase housing opportunity through “gentle density” in a region like LA that has been historically averse to new mid- to high-rise housing developments. Furthermore, ADUs have the potential to enhance affordability for renters, as well as provide low- and middle-income homeowners an additional source of income. 

**Spatial Scope:**

The spatial scope of our proposal will be the boundaries of the city of Los Angeles. We intend to zoom in to a finer level of detail to compare the differences we find in ADU permits in neighborhoods with different median income levels.

**Data Sources:**

We will use two primary types of data sources to tackle this research question. The first type is permit data. This will allow us to determine the date and location of each permit pulled to pursue accessory dwelling unit developments. See the first link below for permit data from 2014 to 2020 for the city of Los Angeles. The second type of data source we will use is American Community Survey income data. The second link below shows income at the block-group (neighborhood) level throughout Los Angeles County.

**Intended Analysis / Visualizations:**

Our analysis will consist of three steps, as shown in the flow chart below. First, we will collect data (see data sources above). Next, we will analyze the data at the block group level, determining both the number of ADUs permitted in and the median income of each block group. Last, we will visualize our results with both a chart and a map.

**Conclusion:**

We expect this research to help us determine whether there is a correlation between the median income of a neighborhood and its number of permitted ADUs. We expect that the permitting of ADUs will be negatively associated with neighborhood income because neighborhoods with more wealth will be more inclined to resist affordable housing options and maintain their exclusivity. Note, however, that while this analysis will help us determine correlation of these two variables, it will not help us determine causation.
