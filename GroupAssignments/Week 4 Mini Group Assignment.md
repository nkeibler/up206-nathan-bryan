# Mini Group Assignment

## Project Title and Link To Proposal

The Relationship of Neighborhood Income to Accessory Dwelling Unit Permitting

https://github.com/nkeibler/up206-nathan-bryan/blob/main/GroupAssignments/Group%20Assignment%201_Project%20Proposal.md

## Roles: 

Nathan: Proactive Permit Puller Person

Bryan: Captain Neighborhood-Character-Determiner

Through the data cleaning and initial analysis process, Nathan will take the lead on the City of Los Angeles development permit data and Bryan will take the lead on the census income data. Once we have conducted the first analysis steps, we will conduct most of the visualization and final analysis together. Throughout the process, we will stay flexible, be collaborative, and not be siloed in our roles. 

## Status update

The team is excited and anxious to get the permit data pulled in. We see a clear path forward in our analysis, but are eager to proceed because we know that stumbling blocks will appear as we get further into the work. 

## Data update

Below are links to our two primary initial data sources: a log of development permits pulled in the City of Los Angeles from 2014-2020 and census data showing income at the block group level. So far, we've dug into the income data and it looks pretty straightforward to work with. We have not yet dug into the permit data analysis, so, as outlined above, we're eager to get to work on it.

## Concerns

#### Major Concerns:
Our only major concern is that we are expecting the unexpected. We expect that as we get further into the analysis process, concerns will arise that we will need to deal with at that time. 

#### Minor Concerns:
We know that we'll need to conduct minor data cleaning for the census income dataset. For example, some block groups show NaN under median income; we believe this is because those block groups have no residents. We'll look further into this, as well as any other data cleaning concerns that arise. 

We are also hopeful that we will have time to sufficiently explore the findings of our analysis. Once we've successfully mapped and analyzed the relationship between neighborhood income and ADU permitting, we're hopeful that we'll still have the capacity to look for other interesting trends or topics of exploration.
